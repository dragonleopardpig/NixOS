\abstract{
Materials sticking to the inner walls of filling machines (e.g. tanks, mixers, augers) is a common problem in the FMCG industry. The problem is further aggravated by processing conditions (temperature, heat, duration, batch size), product characteristics (hygroscopicity of powder) and environmental conditions (temperature, humidity). There is a challenge of cross contamination, especially for batch one (or low MOQ) production, where cleaning after every recipe change is not feasible. The scope includes development of anti-sticking surfaces by micro/nano texturisation of metal parts (stainless steel). Nano texturisation on plastics have been commercialized for optics and medtech applications, but this is not achieved on steel surfaces for tooling yet. Preliminary research by EU Shark Project1 had demonstrated feasibility of laser texturising metals to improve hydrophobicity.

*** Recent advances in designing superhydrophobic surfaces
**** Introduction    
    #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 7cm 
    #+CAPTION: Water Contact Angle Definition
    #+NAME: fig:WaterContact
    [[file:ContactAngle.png]]

    #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 7cm  
    #+CAPTION: Wenzel and Cassie-Bexter state 
    #+NAME: fig:WenzelCassieBexter
    [[file:WenzelCassieBexter.png]]

     - Young Equation of Contact Angle [[fig:WaterContact]]: \(cos\:\theta=\frac{T_{sg} - T_{sl}}{T_{lg}}\)
     - \(\theta \mapsto \begin{cases}
	< 90^\circ, & \text{Hydrophilic} \\
	90^\circ < \theta < 150^\circ, & \text{Hydrophobic} \\
	 > 150^\circ, & \text{SuperHydrophobic}
	\end{cases}\)
 
     - Hydrophobic surface Model [[fig:WenzelCassieBexter]]:
       - Wenzel State:
	 If */r/* is the amplification factor of increased surface area, then:
	 \(r=roughness \: factor=\frac{actual \: surface \: area}{planar \: area}\)
	 therefore \(cos \: \theta\) is modified to become:
	 \(cos \: \theta_{W} = r cos \: \theta\)
       - Cassie-Bexter State:
         \(cos \: \theta_{CB} = f_1 cos \: \theta_1 + f_2 cos \: \theta_2\) where
         \(f_1\) = Surface Fraction of Phase 1 and
         \(f_2\) = Surface Fraction of Phase 2
       - If only one type of protrusion is present, given /f/ the fraction of asperities, (1 - /f/) is the air fraction. Water droplet has a \(180^\circ\) contact angle with air, so the equation becomes:
         \(cos \: \theta_{CB} = f(1 + cos \: \theta_W) - 1\)
       - Intermediate Wenzel-Cassie state:
         \(cos \: \theta_{CW} = rf cos \: \theta + f - 1\)
       - For many surfaces, a transition from Cassie-Baxter to Wenzel state was observed.
     - Reason for Adhesion Hysteresis:
       - Surface Heterogeneity
       - Chemical Heterogeneity
       - Roughness
       - Interaction at the contact line
     - chemical heterogeneity and roughness can engender a contact angle hysteresis (H) between the water front advancing across a surface and receding from the surface. Generally, advancing contact angle ($\theta_A$) exceeds receding contact angle ($\theta_R$).
     - Young equation is valid for ideal, smooth, and homogeneous surfaces; water contact angle is measured at the equilibrium and it is unique.
     - Methods to measure contact angle hysteresis:
       - Sessile Drop Method
       - Sliding Method (self cleaning, usually sliding angle \(\alpha < 10^\circ \)

**** Methods to prepare superhydrophobic surfaces
     - Top-down approach
       - Lithography
       - Template
       - Plasma
     - Bottom-up approach
       - Chemical deposition
       - Layer-by-Layer deposition
       - Colloidal assemblies
     - Combination of both approach
       - Casting of polymer solution
       - Phase seperation
       - Electrospinning
