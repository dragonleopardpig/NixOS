* Introduction
** Gain Medium
- Gives each type of laser its name
- Determines the output /power/ or /energy/
- Ultimate /tuning range/
** Optical Resonator (or Cavity)
- Controls the /spatial quality/
- Controls the /line Width/
** Lasers
- High /spatial coherence/
- High /temporal Coherence/
** Resonator Types
*** Stable
- Stable Resonator :: An extended environment within which the relevant type of wave or oscillation can circulate in a self-consistent fashion.
- Free-space /stable/ standing-wave
- Free-space /stable/ Ring Cavities
- Both constructed with discrete mirrors
- Three dimensional /guided-wave/ resonators
  - Formed out of the gain medium itself
  - Formed out of external reflectors
*** Unstable
- /Unstable/ or /non-confining/ cavities
- Constructed by mirrors of restricted transverse dimension
- Constructed by /spatially graded Reflectivities/
* Fabry-Perot Resonator
- Fabry-Perot cavity :: two mirrors oppose each other across the gain medium.
- Such a resonator provides physical confinement in one dimension only.
- Light simply reflects back and forth along the axis joining the two mirrors.
- Mirror specification (eg. curvatures, sizes, reflectivities) determines the reflection manner.
- Three parameters must remain unchanged after one complete round-trip:
  - the phase of the optical wavefront
  - the on-axis amplitude of the wave
  - the amplitude distribution, transverse to the Axis

:END:
- The oscillating wavelength of the light must correspond to an integer fraction of the cavity round-trip length.
- \(\lambda = \frac{2nL}{q}\)
