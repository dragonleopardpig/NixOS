#+TITLE:	Biomimetics Overview

* Biomimetics
- Biomimetics :: Biomimetics is derived from the Greek word biomimesis. It means mimicking biology or living nature, or living organisms, and is also called biomimicry. Webster's Dinionary defines: The study of the formation, structure or function of biologically produced substances and materials (as enzymes or silk) and biological mechanisms and processes (as protein synthesis or photosynthesis) especially for the purpose of synthesizing similar products by artificial mechanisms which mimic natural ones.
- Bionics :: Bionics combines two words, biology and technology/electronics. It translates to the creation of products, devices, and processes by using materials and processes found in living nature. Bionics today is referred to as robotics and replacement or enhancement of living matter, tissue, body parts, and organs.
- Biognis :: Biognis, which is defined as the scientific investigation of life.
- Golden Ratio :: The Golden Ratio is a unique ratio whose proportions are considered to represent a functional and aesthetic ideal. It is defined as $\frac{\text{length 1}}{\text{length 2}}\approx1.618$, where length 1 and length 2 are larger and smaller dimensions of a rectangle, respectively.
- Fibonacci numbers :: Fibonacci numbers are described by the mathematical expression F_{n}=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}. The sequence begins with the seed values of F_{0}=0$ and $F_{1}=1, then, the recursive expression provides the values following, resulting in 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34,â€¦ and so on.
