     Young Equation of Contact Angle (Fig. [[fig:WaterContact]]):
     $$\cos\theta=\frac{T_{sg} - T_{sl}}{T_{lg}}$$

     $$\theta \mapsto \begin{cases}
	< 90^\circ, & \text{Hydrophilic} \\
	90^\circ < \theta < 150^\circ, & \text{Hydrophobic} \\
	 > 150^\circ, & \text{SuperHydrophobic}
	\end{cases}$$


     Hydrophobic surface Model (Fig. [[fig:WenzelCassieBexter]]):

     - Wenzel State :: 
	 $$r=\text{roughness factor}=\frac{\text{actual surface area}}{\text{planar area}}$$
	 /r/ is the amplification factor of increased surface area.\\
	 Therefore \(\cos\theta\) is modified to become:$$\cos\theta_{W} = r \cos\theta$$
	 
    - Cassie-Bexter State ::
         $$\cos \theta_{CB} = f_1 \cos \theta_1 + f_2 \cos \theta_2$$
	 where
         $$f_1 = \text{Surface Fraction of Phase 1}$$
         and
         $$f_2 = \text{Surface Fraction of Phase 2}$$
     


	 
    If only one type of protrusion is present, given /f/ the fraction of
         asperities, $(1 - f)$ is the air fraction. Water droplet has a
         \(180^\circ\) contact angle with air, so the equation becomes:
         $$\cos \theta_{CB} = f(1 + \cos \theta_W) - 1$$
    Intermediate Wenzel-Cassie state:
         $$\cos \theta_{CW} = rf \cos \theta + f - 1$$	 
    For many surfaces, a transition from Cassie-Baxter to Wenzel state was observed.
    
    Reason for Adhesion Hysteresis:
	 + Surface Heterogeneity
	 + Chemical Heterogeneity
	 + Roughness
	 + Interaction at the contact line


		   
    Chemical heterogeneity and roughness can engender a contact angle hysteresis
(H) between the water front advancing across a surface and receding from the
surface. Generally, advancing contact angle ($\theta_A$) exceeds receding
contact angle ($\theta_R$).  Young equation is valid for ideal, smooth, and
homogeneous surfaces; water contact angle is measured at the equilibrium and it
is unique.

Methods to measure contact angle hysteresis: 
  + Sessile Drop Method
  + Sliding Method (self cleaning, usually sliding angle \(\alpha <10^\circ \))

_Methods to prepare superhydrophobic surfaces:_
1. Top-down approach
   - /Lithography/
   - /Template/
   - /Plasma/
2. Bottom-up approach
   + /Chemical deposition/
   + /Layer-by-Layer deposition/
   + /Colloidal assemblies/
3. Combination of both

_Process Breadown:_
 - Lithography :: process of transferring the geometric patterns of the IC design to a thin layer of polymer, called a /*resist*/, producing a /*resist mask*/ on the surface of the silicon wafer.
 - Template :: material is printed, pressed, or grown against the voids of a
      template. Often, template is removed, leaving the inverse of the original:
      creating replica of the original.

*Light and Matter*
- Thermal light

- Bremsstrahlung
- $\textrm{Schr\"{o}dinger}$ equation:

/_Scattering_/
- Transition takes place via virtual states.
  
*Nonlinear Optical Media* \\
/_Nonlinear_/
- nonlinear(quadratic, cubic) relation between $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{E}$

/_Facts_/
- Refractive Index (speed of light) depends on light intensity.
- Principle of Superposition is violated in nonlinear optical medium.
- Frequency of light is altered as it passes through nonlinear optical medium.
- Photons do interact within the confines of a nonlinear optical medium (light can be used to control light).

/_Principal Assumption_/
+ Optical medium is passive (it does not exchange energy with light waves).
+ Waves of different frequencies may exchange energy with each other iva the nonliear property of the medium, but their total energy is conserved.

/_Chapter Assumption_/
- Light is described by stationary continuous waves.

/_Parametric Interactions_/
- Parameter of the system is varied periodically in time (eg. strong  $\mathcal{E}$ field causes $\chi$ to oscillate in time.)
