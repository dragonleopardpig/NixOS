* org-mode structure
Text in org is structured by headings, denoted by lines starting with
one or more * so we are currently in a section!

** A subheading
Starts with an extra * and so on

** navigation
Headings can be expanded or collapsed by moving to the (sub)heading
and pressing TAB. S-TAB cycles all headings. You can jump to next and
previous headings with C-c C-n and C-c C-p respectively.

You can move headings up and down to reorder them with the arrow keys,
using M-up or M-down. You can change the level of headings with M-left
and M-right (and use M-S-left and M-S-right to also change the levels
of and subheadings).

** lists
*** bullet lists
 - bullet lists can be created like this (start a line with one or
   more space and a -
 - pressing M-RET gives you a new bullet
 - we might also like nested bullets
   - like this one (I pressed M-RET TAB to indent it)
   - and another (M-RET now indents to the new level)
 - the nice thing is that for long lines of text, emacs wraps them
   so that they line up with the bullet
 - you can also reorder list items and change indentation using
   M-up or M-down just like with section headings
 - you can change bullet style using S-left and S-right

*** numbered lists
 1) numbered lists are also possible
 2) M-RET gives me a new number

*** checklists [/]
 - [ ] we can even have check lists
 - [ ] M-S-RET gives a new item with a check box
 - [ ] C-c C-c check/unchecks a box
 - [ ] you can have sub items
   + [ ] like this
   + [ ] that can be checked off individually
 - [ ] and you can track the number of items by adding [/] to the end
   of a line above a checklist - this updates when you check items off

*** definition lists
 - definition lists :: these are useful sometimes
 - item 2 :: M-RET again gives another item, and long lines wrap in a
      tidy way underneath the definition
