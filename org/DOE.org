* Experiments with Two Factors
** Example 1
*** Table
|                 | 580 Low -              | 600 High +             |
| Vendor X Low -  | 18.6, 17.4, Ybar=18.00 | 17.5, 16.5, Ybar=17.00 |
| Vendor Y High + | 18.2, 16.7, Ybar=17.45 | 22.9, 22.2, Ybar=22.55 |
*** The Eight Steps for Analysis of Effects
1. Calculate effects.
2. Make a Pareto chart of effects.
3. Calculate the standard deviation of the experiment, S_{e}.
4. Calculate the standard deviation of the effects, S_{eff}.
5. Determine the t-statistic.
6. Calculate the decision limits and determine the significant effects.
7. Graph significant effects.
8. Model the significant effects.
