# I Love this quote
I was looking for a language with speed of C, with a Free Software license (this
is what we used to call them before term Open-Source was coined) and where I could have dynamic typing too. 

I love read–eval–print loop of Lisp a.k.a REPL. REPL is one of the most amazing
experiences of programming (and yes, it was invented in Lisp).

The other is Emacs, which I will write about someday. I wanted a language where I could use my mind to solve a problem instead of memory
problems and Segfaults. A language that is far simpler than C++ (by all means, C++ is a great language, if I have to create an OS, I would use it. Still, it is
a very complex language to work in). 

Then I came to realize, I was not the only one thinking along those lines. Few Lispers were thinking the same. Then I read Why of Julia:

> We want a language that’s open source, with a liberal license. We want the speed of C with the dynamism of Ruby. We want a language that’s homoiconic, with true macros like Lisp, but with obvious, familiar mathematical notation like Matlab. We want something as usable for general programming as Python, as easy for statistics as R, as natural for string processing as Perl, as powerful for linear algebra as Matlab, as good at gluing programs together as the shell. Something that is dirt simple to learn, yet keeps the most serious hackers happy. We want it interactive and we want it compiled.

(Did we mention it should be as fast as C?)
